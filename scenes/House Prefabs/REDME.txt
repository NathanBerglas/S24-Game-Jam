Ok, so this is how the house prefabs work
Basically you just make clones, arrange them, and then place in a connector_control, which does all of the multi colour wire buisness
If these prefabs are not how you like, or you wish another combinations, you can duplicate them and make sure to change the following, incredibly important things
- Change the inner colour (not technically important)
- For each connection, change metadata so colour is the correct colour (not technically important)
- For each connection, change metadata so Type is either 'Red', 'Green', or 'Blue' (important)
- For each connectino, change group so it has 1 of group 'ConnectionRed', 'ConnectionGreen', or 'ConnectionBlue', also, make sure it has standard group 'coonnection' (all important)
There you go, another house prefab! If you want another building other than a house, all that's neccesary is sprite editing, none of it has any bearing on the tech
The only thing the game interacts with in these prefabs is the connections, so as long as the meta data and groups are set correctly, all will work
